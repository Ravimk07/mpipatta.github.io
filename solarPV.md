## Design & Integration & Installation of a 5-kW Rooftop Solar PV System

On this page, let us discuss how we can design a completely off-grid 5-kW rooftop solar PV system. 

### Design an off-grid 5-kW rooftop solar PV system

First, we need to know what loads we are going to use. In our scenario, we will create a rooftop system that can serve three houses. All three houses have the appliances as listed in the table below.


|                 | Load  (Watt) | Quantity | Total Load  (Watt) | Usage hours  (Hrs/day) | Watt*Hour |
|-----------------|:------------:|:--------:|:------------------:|:----------------------:|-----------|
| Fan             |      50W     |     3    |        150W        |            3           |    450    |
| Exhaust fan     |      30W     |     9    |        270W        |            1           |    270    |
| Light           |      12W     |    33    |        396W        |            4           |   1,584   |
| Fridge          |     150W     |     3    |        450W        |           10           |   4,500   |
| EV              |    1,500W    |     1    |       1,500W       |            3           |   4,500   |
| Pump            |     150W     |     1    |        150W        |            2           |    300    |
| Washing machine |     350W     |     3    |       1,050W       |           1.5          |   1,575   |
| Blender         |     600W     |     1    |        600W        |          0.01          |     6     |
| Rice cooker     |     600W     |     1    |        600W        |          0.02          |     12    |
| Total           |              |          |       4,566W       |                        | 13,185Wh  |


From the table, we can see that the total load if all appliances are used at the same time is 4,566W. This implies that we should at least size our solar panel to cover this amount.

Also, the total W*H is 13,185Wh. Hence, our battery size should be at least 13,185 /0.8 (assuming 80% depth of discharge) /0.95 (assuming 95% inverter efficiency) = 17,349 Wh. 



Then, we can decide the size of each component, i.e., solar panels, battery units and the inverter. It is then the time that we put everything together (integration phase)
